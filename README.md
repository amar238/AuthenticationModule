# Authentication Module

The Authentication Module is a comprehensive solution designed to handle user authentication securely and efficiently. It provides a robust set of features to ensure a seamless and secure authentication process for users, including reCAPTCHA verification, email OTP verification, social media authentication, and password reset functionality.

# Key Features

## reCAPTCHA Verification:
- Implemented reCAPTCHA verification for both sign-in and sign-up processes to prevent bots and ensure the security of user accounts.
## Email OTP Verification:
- For sign-up, users are required to verify their email address using a one-time password (OTP) sent via email. This adds an extra layer of security to the registration process.
## Social Media Authentication:
- Integrated Google social media authentication for seamless sign-in and sign-up using existing Google accounts. This allows users to easily access the platform without the need for separate credentials.
## Parallel Jobs for Email OTPs:
- Utilized parallel job processing to send email OTPs asynchronously, ensuring quick delivery and scalability. This feature enhances the performance of the authentication process, especially during high traffic periods.
## Password Reset Functionality:
- Implemented a password reset functionality to allow users to securely reset their passwords in case they forget or need to update them. This feature enhances user experience and security.
## Error Handling:
Errors are conveyed to User using SweetAlert (Swal).
### Password Mismatch Error:
Users are alerted when the passwords entered during the sign-up or password reset process do not match.
### Empty Password Error:
Users are prevented from submitting empty passwords during the sign-up or password reset process.
### Invalid Characters in Name Error:
Users are notified if they include numbers or special characters in their name during the sign-up process.
### Valid Emails Error:
Users are notified for invalid email input.
